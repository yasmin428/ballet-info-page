        <h1>Ballet</h1>
        <p class="intro">
            Ballet is a dramatic dance form performed to music, using precise and highly formalized set steps and gestures. Classical ballet, which originated in Renaissance Italy and established its present form during the 19th century, is characterized by light,
            graceful movements and the use of pointe shoes with reinforced toes.

                    Rooted in both traditional vocabulary and technique, classical ballet is the most formal of the styles. Itâ€™s best exemplified by pointe work, high extensions, and graceful leaps. Famous productions include Swan Lake and Sleeping Beauty.
